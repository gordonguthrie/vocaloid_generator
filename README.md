# vocaloid_generator

A elixir programme that can read a vocaloid .vpr file (zipped json) and generate chords from a melody on it

For help run `vocaloid --help`

There is an example Vocaloid file and transpose files in `./priv`

Run the examples and examine the output with the batch file `example_script.sh`

By comparing before and after and reading the `example.transpose` file you should be able to understand what this script does.

For a deeper understanding of the transpose file format run the file `test_script.sh` and examine the output and read `test.transpose`
